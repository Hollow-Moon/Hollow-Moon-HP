This project aims to translate the entirety of Mahoutsukai no Yoru into English. We mostly started this because of all of us getting incredibly tired of all of the failed Mahoyo TL attempts that have spawned in the last 8 or so years.

This will be primarily done by getting a first-pass translation by translating the French release by Moon-Trad into English. Then that pass will be rigorously TLC'd to ensure that nothing from the original JP intention (both in terms of meaning and tone / writing style) was lost, circumventing all issues a double translation would normally have. This way we can ease the load such a project would usually have on the JP readers by distributing it to French speakers too. We are aiming to translate all of the games chapters into English ourselves.

As Mcjon01's patch was very detailed in terms of technical work and CG translation, we are reusing those two aspects of his patch as the basis for ours. We have not been able to get in touch with his team so we can not get official permission, but we will be crediting him accordingly. If anyone from said team has an objection to make, please reach out to us. We will make sure to remove and recreate any assets we use from his patch if needed.

We have quite a large team, but none of us are all that experienced with this stuff save for a couple, so it might take a while. We don't want to rush this because we want to provide the highest quality release we are capable of providing.

We have a Discord server where we post progress updates and talk about everything Type-Moon (but not just limited to that). Join if you are interested.
